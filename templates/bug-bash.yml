  ## Bug Bash Roadmap

  ### 1. Triage
  - [ ] Collect and categorise incoming bug reports
  - [ ] Assign severity (critical / high / medium / low)
  - [ ] Assign each bug to an engineer

  ### 2. Fix
  - [ ] Engineer 1: implement fixes for assigned bugs
  - [ ] Engineer 2: implement fixes for assigned bugs
  - [ ] Write or update unit tests for each fix

  ### 3. Verify
  - [ ] QA agent reproduces each bug against the fix branch
  - [ ] Run full test suite — all tests must pass
  - [ ] Confirm no regressions introduced

  ### 4. Close
  - [ ] Merge approved fixes to main
  - [ ] Update issue tracker (close resolved, re-open regressions)
  - [ ] Post sprint summary
